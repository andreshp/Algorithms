# Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Some algorithms based on Dynamic Programming. You can find:

- **Maximum Subarray Problem** : Kadane algorithm for the maximum subarray problem. Efficiency: O(*n*).
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence** : Some algorithms to get the longest increasing subsequence in a given array. Efficiency: O(*n* log *n*).
