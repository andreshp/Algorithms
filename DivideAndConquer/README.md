# Divide And Conquer Algorithms

Some Divide and Conquer Algorithms. You can find:

- **ClosestPair** : Algorithm O(n log n) that return the closest pair of points of a given set.
- **NestedInterval** : Algorithm O(n logÂ² n) that, given an intervals array, compute for each interval those array's intervals contained in it.
- **PeakFinding** : Algorithms for finding a peak in an array or matrix.
