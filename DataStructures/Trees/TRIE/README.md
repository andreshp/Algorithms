# TRIE

## Definition

A TRIE is a general tree where the elements stored can be represented as a finite sequence of elements of a set S. This representation is called a word. The elements of S are used as nodes and a path from the root to the leaves indicates a word.

## Implementation

The implementation is done in c++. There is a GeneralTree class with general tree operations and a Trie class that supports the TRIE operations. 

## Example

An example of use can be seen in my repository CifrasYLetras to solve the Letras problem.
