#----------------------------- EXPLANATION ------------------------------#

# Let's denote LIS[i] the length of the longest increasing sequence
# ending at component i. 
# 
# We want to find the value LIS[i] for all i. It is trivial that the longest
# increasing sequence length is the maximum of LIS[i] for all i.
# 
# We have:
# 1. LIS[0] = 1 
# 2. LIS[i] = max(LIS[j] + 1 for al j in J) if J not empty else 1
#   where J = {j: i > j, A[i] > A[j]}
# 
# This allows us to compute LIS[i] for all i easily in O(nÂ²) and, thus,
# the longest increasing subsequence length.
#
# There is a solution O(n log n) for the longest increasing subsequence problem
# using the dynamic approach explained before that is just a consequence of segment trees. 
# Let's try to develop it.
# 
# We are given a vector A for which we want to compute the LIS. Now A is sorted to
# obtain B, the permutation of indexes that sorts it.
#   
# 3. If we want the longest strictly increasing subsequence then we need that if i < j and
#   A[i] = A[j] then B[i] > B[j] to avoid taking equals elements in the subsequence.
# 4. If we want the longest non-decreasing subsequence then we need that if i < j and 
#   A[i] = A[j] then B[i] < B[j]. This will allow us adding j to a subsequence ending at i,
#   obtaining the LIS (non-decreasing).
# 
# Let's build a segment tree initialized with LIS. Consequently, the i-th leaf will contain
# the length of the LIS ending at i when we finnish the algorithm. At first those value will be 0
# (we haven't computed them yet). The segment tree will allow to get the maximum of 
# those values in a subinterval.
# 
# For each element in B we can compute the LIS ending in that element. In order to do that, 
# first find the element in [0,B[i]-1] with longest LIS.
# That element has been procesed before B[i] (else its node value is 0) so it is smaller
# than B[i] (or equal if we did 4). We can get the LIS for B[i] appendig it to the
# LIS of the obtained element . Then the length of the LIS for B[i] is updated.
# This process is just 2:
# 
# LIS[B[i]] = max(LIS[j] + 1 for al j in J) where J = {j: B[i] > j, A[i] > A[j]}.
# 
# This sofisticated scheme leads us for a easy proof since it is equivalent to the dynamic
# solution operations. The difference is that at each step we get the LIS for the smallest
# element not processed yet. We can do this since bigger elements do not affect to the LIS
# of smaller ones (as 2 says). The proof is by induction: 
# - For B[0] its trivial that we have computed the LIS. 
# - Let's suppose it is true for B[j] with j < i < len(B). Then:
#   LIS[B[i]] = max(LIS[j] + 1 for al j in J) where J = {j: B[i] > j, A[i] > A[j]}.
#   But J = {B[j] with B[j] < B[i] for all j < i} and:
#   LIS[B[i]] = max(LIS[B[j]] for j < i, B[j] < b[i]) = SegmentTree.getMaximumLIS([0, B[i]-1])
#   (if j >= i then LIS[j] = 0 and won't affect to the segment tree search).
#   This is exactly what we do.
