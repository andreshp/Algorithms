# Data Structures

Every Data Structure that I have implemented. They are classified according their operations supported.

- **Binary Search Trees** : Binary search trees such as AVL.
- **Heaps** : Heaps kind of structures. They support insertions in O(log n), getting a element in a fixed position beforehand in O(1) and deleting that element in O(log n).
- **SegmentTrees** : Different Segment Trees versions in order to support every possible operation: search, update an element, range update, range update with lazy propagation... 
- **IntervalTree** : Tree to keep intervals. Allows finding overlapped intervals.
- **TRIE** : TRIE implementation. Allows inserting and finding words in O(word length). Saves a lot of memory since prefixes are shared between words.
