# Data Structures

Every Data Structure that I have implemented. They are classified according their operations supported.

- **Heaps** : Heaps kind of structures. They support insertions in O(log n), getting a element in a fixed position beforehand in O(1) and deleting that element in O(log n).
- **Trees** : Tree structures such as AVL trees and TRIEs.
