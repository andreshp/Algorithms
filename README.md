# Algorithms
All the algorithms I have implemented classified accordingly their purpose.
(Need a whole update when I have time).

You can find the following directories:

- **Algebra** : Algorithms related to Algebra (find primes numbers, greatest common divisor)
- **AsymptoticProblems** : Problems related to Asymptotic Complexity Theory.
- **ClosestPair** : Algorithm O(n log n) that return the closest pair of points of a given set.
- **Graphs** : Graphs algorithms for different problems such as the Minimum Cut Problem.
- **PeakFinding** : Algorithms for finding a peak in an array or matrix. A peak is a element that is smaller than its neighbours.
- **SelectionAlgorithms** : Some selection algorithms and variants (quickselect).
- **SortingAlgorithms** : Some sorting algorithms and variants (quicksort, heapsort, mergesort, timsort).
