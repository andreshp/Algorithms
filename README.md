# Algorithms
All the algorithms I have implemented classified accordingly theirs purpose.
(Need a whole update when I have time).

You can find the following directories:

- SortingAlgorithms : Some sorting algorithms (quicksort, heapsort)
- Algebra: Algorithms related to Algebra (find primes numbers, greatest common divisor)
- PeakFinding : Algorithms for finding a peak in an array or matrix. A peak is a element that is smaller than its neighbours.
