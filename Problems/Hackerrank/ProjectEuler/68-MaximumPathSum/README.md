# Maximum Path Sum

The presented problem is from [Hackerrank and Project Euler](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler067).

## Statement
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. The path is denoted by numbers in bold.

~~~
   3  
  7 4  
 2 4 6  
8 5 9 3
~~~

That is, 3+7+4+9=23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle given in input.

## Solution
