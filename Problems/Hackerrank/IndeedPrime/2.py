# Use topological sort idea to find the largest path between two nodes.
# If there is a cycle then solution is never.

# A Graph class. A graph is represented by its adjacency list.
class Graph(object):

    # The class is conformed by these members:
    #  - adj_list : Adjacency list to represent the graph. It is implemented as a dictionary of dictionaries.
    #               The first dictionary's keys are the nodes of the graph. Its values are dictionaries with
    #               the key's neighbours and the number of edges between them.
    #  - num_edges : Number of edges in the graph.
    #  - type_node : Type of the graph nodes. It is int by default.
    #  
    #  The graph admits multiples edges from one node to another thanks to the dictionary of dictionaries implementation.

    # This allows us finding the largest path from a subject to another.
