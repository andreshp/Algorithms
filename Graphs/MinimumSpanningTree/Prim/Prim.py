# MinHeap Class.
# A heap is a representation of a complete binary tree as an array.
# The array has the Breadth-First Order of the nodes. Consecuently,
# the following equitities are true:
#    leftChild(index) = 2*index+1
#    rightChild(index) = 2*index+2
#    parent(index) = (index-1) // 2
#
# A MinHeap is a heap where there is a total order relation and verifies the following property:
#    "heap[i] >= heap[parent(i)] for all i in range(0, size())"
# analogously:
#    "Each children is greater or equal than its parent."
# 
# Consecuently,  heap[0] is the minimum of the elements of the heap.
# A MinHeap supports the following operations:
#    - Get the minimum in O(1) (return heap[0])
#    - Insert an element in O(log n)
#    - Delete an element in O(log n)
