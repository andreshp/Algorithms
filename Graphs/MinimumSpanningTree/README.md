# Minimmum Spanning Tree

Algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected graph.

- **Prim's Algorithm** : Implementation with heaps. **Efficiency**: O(|*E*| log |*V*|)
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** : Implementation with Union - Find Structure. **Efficiency**: O(|*E*| log |*V*|). In practice this is the faster algorithm.
