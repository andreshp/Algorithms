# Shortest Path Algorithms

Algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

- **Breadth First Search** : Also known as BFS, it finds the shortest path between two nodes in a non-weighted graph. **Efficiency**: O(|*V*|+|*E*|)
- **Dijkstra Algorithm** : Finds the shortest path between a node and every other one for weighted graphs with no negative weigths. **Efficiency**: O(|*E*|log|*V*|)
