# Depth-First Search for finding a Topological Sort of a Directed Graph
########################################################################

# This program read a directed graph as an adjacency list from a file. 
# Afterwards it executes the DFS algorithm on it to find a topological sort
# of the graph if it is possible (the graph must be acyclic, what is 
# checked in the code). It then prints the result.
# 
# More info about topological sort: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting

# A Graph class. A graph is represented by its adjacency list.
class Graph(object):

    # The class is conformed by these members:
    #  - adj_list : Adjacency list to represent the graph. It is implemented as a dictionary of dictionaries.
    #               The first dictionary's keys are the nodes of the graph. Its values are dictionaries with
    #               the key's neighbours and the number of edges between them.
    #  - outdegree : Dictionary which maps for each node its outdegree (The number of edges leaving from this node).
    #  - num_edges : Number of edges in the graph.
    #  - type_node : Type of the graph nodes. It is int by default.
    #  
    #  The graph admits multiples edges from one node to another thanks to the dictionary of dictionaries implementation.
