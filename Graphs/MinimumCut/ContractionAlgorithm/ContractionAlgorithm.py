#######################################################################

# This program read a graph as an adjacency list from a file a execute the 
# Contraction Algorithm for the Minimum Cut Problem. Afterwards, the number
# of crossing edges in the min cut is printed. The user can choose between
# printing or not the sets of vertices A and B of the minimum cut (A,B).

# The graph is assumed to be undirected.
class Graph(object):

    # The class is conformed by these members:
    #  - adj_list : Adjacency list to represent the graph. It is implemented as a dictionary of dictionaries.
    #               The first dictionary's keys are the vertices of the graph. Its values are dictionaries with
    #               the key's neighbours and the number of edges between them.
    #  - vertices_degree : Dictionary which maps for each vertex its degree.
    #  - num_edges : Number of edges in the graph.
    #  - type_vertices : Type of the graph vertices. It is int by default.
    #  
    #  The graph admits multiples edges from one vertex to another thanks to the dictionary of dictionaries implementation.
