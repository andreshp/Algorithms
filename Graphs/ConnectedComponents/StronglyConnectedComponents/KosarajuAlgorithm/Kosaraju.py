# Kosaraju's Algorithm to find the Strongly Connected Components of a Directed Graph
######################################################################################

# This program read a directed graph as an adjacency list from a file. 
# Afterwards it executes Kosaraju's algorithm on it to find a the strongly
# connected components of the graph. It then prints the size of the 5 biggest ones.
# 
# More info about topological sort: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting

class Graph(object):

    # The class is conformed by these members:
    #  - adj_list : Adjacency list to represent the graph. It is implemented as a dictionary of set.
    #               The first dictionary's keys are the nodes of the graph. Its values are sets with
    #               the key's neighbours.
    #  - num_edges : Number of edges in the graph.
    #  - type_node : Type of the graph nodes. It is int by default.
    #  
    #  The graph admits multiples edges from one node to another thanks to the dictionary of dictionaries implementation.
