# This program read a graph as an adjacency list from a file. 
# Afterwards it executes de BFS algorithm on it to find the number of
# connected components of the graph. The user can choose between printing 
# them or not.

# A Graph class. A graph is represented by its adjacency list.
class Graph(object):

    # The class is conformed by these members:
    #  - adj_list : Adjacency list to represent the graph. It is implemented as a dictionary of dictionaries.
    #               The first dictionary's keys are the nodes of the graph. Its values are dictionaries with
    #               the key's neighbours and the number of edges between them.
    #  - outdegree : Dictionary which maps for each node its outdegree (The number of edges leaving from this node).
    #  - num_edges : Number of edges in the graph.
    #  - type_node : Type of the graph nodes. It is int by default.
    #  
    #  The graph admits multiples edges from one node to another thanks to the dictionary of dictionaries implementation.
